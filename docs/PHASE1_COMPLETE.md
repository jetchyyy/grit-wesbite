## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before going live, complete these steps:

1. **Firebase Setup**

   - [ ] Enable Authentication (Email + Google)
   - [ ] Create Firestore database
   - [ ] Enable Cloud Storage
   - [ ] Create admin user
   - [ ] Set admin role in Firestore

2. **Security Rules**

   - [ ] Deploy Firestore rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
   - [ ] Deploy Storage rules: `firebase deploy --only storage`

3. **Environment Variables**

   - [ ] Set up `.env` with Firebase config
   - [ ] Never commit `.env` to Git

4. **Testing**

   - [ ] Test login/logout flow
   - [ ] Test adding/editing/deleting classes

   - [ ] Test image uploads
   - [ ] Test on mobile devices

5. **Production Build**
   - [ ] Run `npm run build` successfully

## 💰 Cost Estimate (Firebase Free Tier)

### Current Usage Estimate

- **Storage**: ~1-2GB (images)
- **Firestore Reads**: ~10k/month (low traffic)
- **Firestore Writes**: ~1k/month (admin updates)
- **Storage Downloads**: ~5GB/month

### Free Tier Limits

- **Storage**: 5GB ✅
- **Firestore Reads**: 50k/day ✅
- **Firestore Writes**: 20k/day ✅
- **Storage Downloads**: 1GB/day ✅

**Verdict**: Should stay within free tier for initial months.
