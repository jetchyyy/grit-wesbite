9. Click "Add Feature"
10. Feature appears on landing page immediately

### Editing an Existing Feature

1. Navigate to `/admin/features`
2. Click "Edit" on feature card
3. Modify any fields (title, description, icon, benefits, images)
4. Add or remove benefits as needed
5. Add or remove gallery images as needed

## Data Flow

```
Admin Dashboard (ManageFeatures.tsx)
  ↓
Upload Image → Firebase Storage (features/)
  ↓
Save Metadata → Firestore (media collection)
  ↓
Save Feature → Firestore (features collection)
  ↓
Landing Page (Features.tsx) → Fetch & Display
  ↓
User Click → Open Modal (FeatureModal.tsx)
  ↓
Display Full Description, Benefits, Gallery
```

---

## Icon Mapping

The admin stores icon names as strings, which are mapped to actual React components on the frontend:

```typescript
const iconMap = {
  Zap: Zap, // Lightning bolt
  Users: Users, // Group of people
  Trophy: Trophy, // Achievement trophy
  Heart: Heart, // Heart shape
  Dumbbell: Dumbbell, // Weightlifting
  Target: Target, // Bullseye target
};
```

If an invalid icon name is stored, it defaults to `Zap`.

---

## Fallback Behavior

If Firestore fetch fails or returns empty:

- Frontend displays 4 default features (Equipment, Trainers, Classes, Community)
- Default features use placeholder images from Unsplash
- Ensures landing page never appears broken
- Admin should populate features ASAP to replace defaults

---

## Security

### Firestore Rules

```javascript
match /features/{featureId} {
  allow read: if true;  // Public can view
  allow create, update, delete: if isAdmin();  // Only admins can modify
}
```

### Storage Rules

```javascript
match /features/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if true;  // Public can view images
  allow write: if isAdmin();  // Only admins can upload
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Features Not Displaying

**Cause:** Empty features collection in Firestore  
**Solution:** Add features via admin panel at `/admin/features`  
**Fallback:** Default features display automatically

### Icon Not Showing

**Cause:** Invalid iconName in Firestore document  
**Solution:** Edit feature, select valid icon from dropdown  
**Fallback:** Displays Zap icon if invalid

### Benefits Not Saving

**Cause:** All benefit inputs are empty  
**Solution:** Add at least one non-empty benefit  
**Validation:** Form requires minimum 1 benefit

### Delete Fails

**Cause:** Image deletion error (already fixed with try-catch)  
**Solution:** Delete continues even if image deletion fails  
**Result:** Feature removed from Firestore successfully

### Gallery Not Showing in Modal

**Cause:** Gallery field is empty or missing  
**Solution:** Upload gallery images in admin panel  
**Fallback:** FeatureModal shows placeholder images
