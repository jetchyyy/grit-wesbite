# Security Measures - Brute Force Protection

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Date:** October 21, 2025

## Overview

Comprehensive security measures have been implemented to prevent brute force attacks on login credentials and unauthorized access to admin URIs.

---

## 🛡️ Security Layers Implemented

### 1. **Client-Side Rate Limiting** (Login.tsx)

**Location:** `src/pages/admin/Login.tsx`

#### Configuration:
```typescript
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5         // Maximum failed login attempts
LOCKOUT_DURATION = 15 min // Account lockout duration
ATTEMPT_WINDOW = 5 min    // Time window for counting attempts
```

#### Features:
- ✅ **Attempt Tracking** - Counts failed login attempts in 5-minute window
- ✅ **Progressive Warning** - Shows remaining attempts after each failure
- ✅ **Account Lockout** - Locks account for 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ **Real-time Countdown** - Displays remaining lockout time
- ✅ **Automatic Reset** - Clears attempts after successful login
- ✅ **Window Expiration** - Resets counter if no attempts in 5 minutes

#### How It Works:
```typescript
// Attempt 1-4: Warning shown with remaining attempts
"Incorrect password. (4 attempts remaining)"

// Attempt 5: Account locked
"Account Temporarily Locked
Too many failed login attempts. Please try again in:
14:59"

// After lockout expires: Counter resets
```

---

### 2. **Input Validation** (Login.tsx)

#### Pre-submission Checks:
```typescript
✓ Email format validation (regex pattern)
✓ Password minimum length (6 characters)
✓ Empty field prevention
✓ Whitespace trimming
```

#### Validation Examples:
```typescript
// Invalid email
Email: "notanemail"
Error: "Please enter a valid email address."

// Short password
Password: "12345"
Error: "Password must be at least 6 characters."

// Empty fields
Error: "Please enter both email and password."
```

---

### 3. **Firebase Authentication** (Built-in)

#### Automatic Protections:
- ✅ **Firebase Rate Limiting** - Prevents excessive auth requests
- ✅ **IP-based Blocking** - Firebase blocks suspicious IPs
- ✅ **CAPTCHA** - Automatically shown after repeated failures
- ✅ **Account Disabling** - Admins can disable compromised accounts

#### Firebase Error Handling:
```typescript
// User-friendly error messages
auth/user-not-found → "No account found with this email"
auth/wrong-password → "Incorrect password"
auth/too-many-requests → "Too many attempts. Try again later"
auth/user-disabled → "This account has been disabled"
```

---

### 4. **Firestore Security Rules** (Server-side)

**Location:** `firestore.rules`

#### New Helper Functions:

```javascript
// Email verification check (optional extra layer)
function isVerified() {
  return request.auth.token.email_verified == true;
}

// Rate limiting - prevents rapid writes
function notTooFrequent(lastWrite) {
  return request.time > lastWrite + duration.value(1, 's');
}

// Payload size validation - prevents DOS attacks
function isValidSize() {
  return request.resource.size() < 1000000; // 1MB limit
}
```

#### Applied to All Collections:
```javascript
// Example: Classes collection
match /classes/{classId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow create: if isAdmin() && isValidSize();
  allow update: if isAdmin() && isValidSize() && 
                   notTooFrequent(resource.data.lastModified);
  allow delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents rapid-fire updates (min 1 second between writes)
- ✅ Blocks oversized payloads (max 1MB per document)
- ✅ Validates admin role on every request
- ✅ Server-side validation (can't be bypassed)

---

### 5. **Route Protection** (PrivateRoute Component)

**Location:** `src/components/admin/PrivateRoute.tsx`

#### Access Requirements:
```typescript
1. User must be logged in (Firebase Auth)
2. User must have role: "admin" in Firestore
3. Loading state shown during verification
4. Automatic redirect to /admin/login if unauthorized
```

#### Access Flow:
```
User visits /admin/*
       ↓
Check Firebase Auth → Not logged in → Redirect to /admin/login
       ↓ Logged in
Check Firestore role → Not admin → Redirect to /admin/login
       ↓ Admin role
✅ Grant access to admin dashboard
```

---

## 🔐 Additional Security Best Practices

### 1. **Hide Admin Links from Navigation**

Add to `Navigation.tsx`:
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../hooks/useAuth';

export default function Navigation() {
  const { isAdmin } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* Regular navigation */}
      
      {/* Only show to admins */}
      {isAdmin && (
        <a href="/admin">Admin Dashboard</a>
      )}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

---

### 2. **Robots.txt Configuration**

**Location:** `public/robots.txt`

```txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin
Disallow: /admin/*

# Sitemap
Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

**Purpose:**
- ✅ Prevents search engines from indexing admin pages
- ✅ Hides admin URLs from Google/Bing search results
- ✅ Reduces discovery of admin routes

---

### 3. **Security Headers** (Add to hosting)

If using Firebase Hosting, create `firebase.json`:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
            "value": "nosniff"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-Frame-Options",
            "value": "DENY"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
            "value": "1; mode=block"
          },
          {
            "key": "Referrer-Policy",
            "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
          },
          {
            "key": "Permissions-Policy",
            "value": "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "source": "/admin/**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### 4. **Environment Variables** (Firebase Config)

Keep sensitive config in `.env.local`:

```env
# .env.local (NOT committed to git)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

Use in code:
```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  // ... other config
};
```

---

### 5. **API Key Restrictions** (Firebase Console)

1. Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service accounts
2. Click "Web API Key"
3. Add restrictions:
   - **HTTP referrers:** `yourdomain.com/*`
   - **Application restrictions:** Set allowed domains
   - **API restrictions:** Enable only needed APIs

---

## 🧪 Testing Security Measures

### Test 1: Rate Limiting
```
1. Open /admin/login
2. Enter wrong password 5 times
3. Verify lockout message appears
4. Verify countdown timer works
5. Wait for lockout to expire
6. Verify counter resets
```

### Test 2: Direct URL Access
```
1. Open incognito window
2. Visit: http://localhost:5173/admin
3. Verify redirect to /admin/login
4. Try: /admin/classes
5. Verify redirect to /admin/login
```

### Test 3: Non-Admin User
```
1. Create user without admin role
2. Login successfully
3. Try to access /admin
4. Verify redirect to /admin/login
5. Check browser console for auth check
```

### Test 4: Rapid Write Attempts
```
1. Login as admin
2. Create a class
3. Try to update it immediately
4. Verify 1-second rate limit enforced
5. Wait 1 second, try again
6. Verify update succeeds
```

### Test 5: Google Sign-In Popup Cancel
```
1. Click "Sign in with Google"
2. Cancel the popup
3. Verify this doesn't count as failed attempt
4. Verify no lockout triggered
```

## 📊 Security Metrics Dashboard

Consider logging security events:

```typescript
// Add to Login.tsx
const logSecurityEvent = async (event: string, details: any) => {
  if (window.location.hostname !== 'localhost') {
    await addDoc(collection(db, 'securityLogs'), {
      event,
      details,
      timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
      userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
      ip: 'detected-by-server', // Use server-side function
    });
  }
};

// Usage:
recordFailedAttempt();
logSecurityEvent('failed_login', { email, remainingAttempts });
```

## 🚨 Attack Scenarios & Defenses

### Scenario 1: Credential Stuffing
**Attack:** Attacker tries thousands of email/password combinations
**Defense:** 
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 attempts per 5 minutes)
- ✅ 15-minute lockout after 5 failures
- ✅ Firebase's built-in IP blocking
- ✅ CAPTCHA after repeated failures

### Scenario 2: Direct API Access
**Attack:** Attacker bypasses UI and calls Firebase API directly
**Defense:**
- ✅ Firestore security rules validate every request
- ✅ Admin role required for all write operations
- ✅ Size limits prevent payload overflow
- ✅ Rate limits prevent spam

### Scenario 3: URL Guessing
**Attack:** Attacker tries common admin URLs (/admin, /cms, /dashboard)
**Defense:**
- ✅ PrivateRoute redirects unauthorized users
- ✅ robots.txt hides admin routes from search engines
- ✅ No links to /admin on public pages
- ✅ Auth check on every admin route

### Scenario 4: Session Hijacking
**Attack:** Attacker steals Firebase auth token
**Defense:**
- ✅ Firebase tokens expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Refresh tokens stored securely (httpOnly)
- ✅ HTTPS enforced (tokens encrypted in transit)
- ✅ Role verified on every request (can't fake admin role)

### Scenario 5: CSRF Attacks
**Attack:** Attacker tricks admin into making malicious requests
**Defense:**
- ✅ Firebase Auth tokens include CSRF protection
- ✅ Same-origin policy enforced
- ✅ Security headers prevent embedding
- ✅ Admin actions require authentication
